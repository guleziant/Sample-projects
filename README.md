===============

some sample projects of my coding style in java

The first project implements a graph structure and traverses it through a depth first search and breadth first search.

The second project implements a general tree structure and traverses it in both level order and preorder. 

The third project is a basic stock ledger application which keeps track of your buys and sells.
